# 0x02. Python - Import & Modules

This is the README file for the 0x02. Python - Import & Modules project.

## Description

In this project, we will explore the concept of importing modules in Python. We will learn how to import built-in modules, third-party modules, and how to create our own modules. We will also cover topics such as module aliases, module search path, and the `__name__` variable.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of modules in Python
- Import built-in modules and third-party modules
- Create and import your own modules
- Use module aliases
- Understand the module search path
- Understand the `__name__` variable and its usage

## Files

The following files are included in this project:

- `0-add.py`: A Python script that imports a function from another module and uses it to perform addition.
- `1-calculation.py`: A Python script that imports multiple functions from another module and uses them to perform calculations.
- `2-args.py`: A Python script that prints the number of arguments and the list of arguments passed to it.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: A Python script that takes any number of arguments and prints their sum.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: A Python script that prints all the names defined by a module.
- `5-variable_load.py`: A Python script that imports a variable from another module and prints its value.

## Usage

To use the scripts in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the desired script using the Python interpreter.
